# Overhang Test (05-2023)
- Test File: [Overhang Test by tomi3d](https://www.printables.com/model/126029-overhang-test)
- Filament: PLA - [Redline Filament Yellow](https://www.redline-filament.com/collections/pla-filament/products/premium-pla-gelb)
- Printer: V0.2 with Mini-Stealthburner. Enclosure on, Door open, Tophat closed
- Auxilliary Fan was installed on the right side of the printer
- Sliced with OrcaSlicer, same G-Code for all prints only the fan was swapped out or unplugged. PartCooling and Auxilliary Fan were set to 100% after the 3rd layer. Settings are at the [end of this document](#print-settings)

## Results
TL;DR: Bigger Fan means better cooling. The 75x30mm Blower fan seems to be a reasonable choice.

Most of the prints got knocked off the build plate or partially broken because of the severe curling at steeper overhangs. The only one that managed to print fully was the one with the 120x32mm fan. However as the sample size for each fan was only one print this might have been luck.

With incrasing fan size and so with higher air flow the overhangs get cleaner. However towards the higher end the difference gets quite small, the 120mm and 97mm fan almost perform the same in this test.

Also notable is the fact that the Mini-Stealthburner severly struggles with cooling faces/overhangs that face towards the rear of the printer. This Area is improved quite significantly with the airflow of the larger fans.

Overall I would say the 75x30mm fan provides a good enough performance for the build volume of a V0. Everything bigger seems overkill for "reasonable" print speeds, however if you want to push your printer to the absolute maximum (shoutout [247printing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IRUQBTPgon4)) you probably want to go all the way to the 120mm one.

The 50x15mm fan doesn't perform very well, however it still improves the overhang-performance by around 10Â° and chances are generally quite high that 3d-printer builders have some of these lying around already so you might just try it. Also there have been some people putting one fan on each side of the printer and beeing quite happy with the improved cooling, however I have not tested this configuration yet.
