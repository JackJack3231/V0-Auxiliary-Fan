SHCS instead of BHCS will also work.

The Fan I used was this [GDSTIME 12032 24V Dual Ball Bearing Blower Fan](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005288258849.html)

## Printed Parts

You'll need to print 1 [12032_Clamp.stl](STL/12032_Clamp.stl), 1 [12032_Shroud_Bottom.stl](STL/12032_Shroud_Bottom.stl) and 1 [12032_Shroud_Top.stl](STL/12032_Shroud_Top.stl)

## Assembly Instructions

#### Remove the built-in Supports from the shroud, use some Flush-Cutters for the supports inside the ducts:

- Top:
  ![Top Support](images/Support_Top.png)
- Bottom:

#### Insert 9x Heatsets For the fan from the front. **CAUTION** the printed part is 4mm thick, so the Heatset is exactly the same length as the part. Don't push the Heatset through by accident.

#### Insert 3x Heatsets For the clamp from the back.

#### Secure the fan with 3x M3x8 BHCS and a Washer in the corners and 6x M3x35 BHCS and a Washer in the rest of the fan mounting holes.

#### The remaining steps are the same as for the [5015 duct](/ducts/5015/README.md#slide-the-shroud-into-the-frame-on-whichever-side-you-prefer).
