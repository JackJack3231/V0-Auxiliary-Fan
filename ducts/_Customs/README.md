# Custom fan ducts

In this folder you will find ducts that I made upon request for specific setups.
Feel free to reach out to me if you need a custom duct made for your printer and fan setup, however I cannot guarantee that I will have the time to actually make it.

Also, I will only update these upon request.

BOM is generally the same as the standard versions unless specifically called out.
