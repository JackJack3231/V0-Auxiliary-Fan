# UHF Ducts
Here you will find ducts with a 3 mm lower outlet to better target the air for longer toolheads/Hotends.

**These are not required for High Flow setups that don't change the nozzle height, like chirpy's [Rapid Burner](https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/V0/Rapid_Burner). If your setup has the nozzle at the same height as the stock Mini-Stealthburner you will need the "standard" ducts instead.**

If you need a different height for the outlet there is a [guide to edit the base Fusion360 CAD Files](/docs/CAD_Outlet_Height.md) in the docs' folder.
