| M3x20 BHCS            | 2        | M3x18 also works, then you don't need the printed spacer |
| M3 Washer             | 2        | optional, only to make better contact with the fan       |

The Fan I used was this [GDSTIME 5015 24V Dual Ball Bearing Blower Fan](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32865977791.html)

## Printed Parts

Print the parts according to your choice of mount. If you are using M3x20 BHCS don't forget to print 2 of the spacers.

## Assembly Instructions
Follow the [General Assembly Instructions](/docs/general_assembly.md).

To secure the fan to the duct use the M3x20 BHCS with a washer and the printed spacer. Alternatively use M3x18 BHCS with a washer but without the spacer.
